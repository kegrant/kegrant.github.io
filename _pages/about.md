About me
======

I am a geochemist and biogeochemist who focuses on the weathering of the Critical Zone. I am interested in understanding organic carbon preservation through time by combining novel isotopic techniques to disentangle the competing roles of carbon degradation/oxidation, mineral-carbon interactions, and environmental controls on organic carbon persistence though recent and past geologic timescales to inform global change.
